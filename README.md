# SimpleMvvm

This is a simple implementation of the MVVM which was designed in minimalist style and doesn't contain a hidden behaviour as an integrated IoC or a bootstrapper. Framework implements the only functions which was required to implement my own applications.

I develop this simple MVVM implementation to use in my own projects, but I would be happy if some one use it.
